# v0.0.5

這個版本根據上衣版本做修正，因為 `get_specific_cube` 會導致模型不斷地因為找尋 cube 而無法正確完成步驟，因此拿掉這個 tool，因為在模型失敗的時候觀察到，模型是能自行判斷要輸入的 cube 為和，因此無須多一個 tool 讓模型找尋欲抓取的 cube。

Result
---
1. 模型能夠成功判斷需要抓取的 cube，並且可以每次抓取 cube 前都能夠減少一個步驟，並且減少模型原地打轉的次數。

Problems
---
1. 目前的 prompt 可能導致模型在得到所有 cubes 時，便自行中斷作業。
2. 目前雖加入 cube 放入 A, B 區須保持間隔，不過模型並沒有採納，仍然都放置在中心點。
3. 加入 "If you know the next step to proceed, please keep going." 為了解決 (1) 會導致先去 `detect_all_cubes`
4. 失敗原因﹔`Now, I need to determine which cubes are blue and calculate the number of cubes to pick and place.`, `Now, we can proceed with picking up the specific cubes and placing them in the respective areas.` 已經找到了，並且拿到資訊後又說需要 determine which cubes are blue 一次。
    1. 嘗試加入 `If you have identified all the cubes, you must continue with the plans that you need to complete.` 這個 prompt，有改善。

Entering new AgentExecutor chain...  
Thought: To achieve the goal of placing the red cubes in Area A and the remaining cubes in Area B, we need to follow the steps and use the specific tools. We also have the information about the boundaries and centers of both areas, as well as the spacing between the cubes.

Action:
```
{
  "action": "get_scene",
  "action_input": {}
}
```


Observation:  
        Scene captured and base64_str stored in scene_info.txt successfully!!!

Thought:Now that we have captured the scene information, we can proceed with the next step of detectingall the cubes present in the scene.

Action:
```
{
  "action": "detect_all_cubes",
  "action_input": {
    "scene_info_file_path": "scene_info.txt"
