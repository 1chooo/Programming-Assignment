# review for a blender

So, they still had the 17 piece system on seasonal \
sale for around $49 in the month of November, about \
half off, but for some reason (call it price gouging) \
around the second week of December the prices all went \
up to about anywhere from between $70-$89 for the same \
system. And the 11 piece system went up around $10 or \
so in price also from the earlier sale price of $29. \
So it looks okay, but if you look at the base, the part \
where the blade locks into place doesnâ€™t look as good \
as in previous editions from a few years ago, but I \
plan to be very gentle with it (example, I crush \
very hard items like beans, ice, rice, etc. in the \ 
blender first then pulverize them in the serving size \
I want in the blender then switch to the whipping \
blade for a finer flour, and use the cross cutting blade \
first when making smoothies, then use the flat blade \
if I need them finer/less pulpy). Special tip when making \
smoothies, finely cut and freeze the fruits and \
vegetables (if using spinach-lightly stew soften the \ 
spinach then freeze until ready for use-and if making \
sorbet, use a small to medium sized food processor) \ 
that you plan to use that way you can avoid adding so \
much ice if at all-when making your smoothie. \
After about a year, the motor was making a funny noise. \
I called customer service but the warranty expired \
already, so I had to buy another one. FYI: The overall \
quality has gone done in these types of products, so \
they are kind of counting on brand recognition and \
consumer loyalty to maintain sales. Got it in about \
two days.

# In general, when building applications 
# where you want a kind of predictable response, 
# I would recommend using temperature zero. 
# 
# If you're trying to build a system that is 
# reliable and predictable, you should go with 0. If you're trying to 
# kind of use the model in a more creative way where you 
# might kind of want 
# a kind of wider variety of different outputs, 
# you might want to use a higher temperature.
# 
# So, to summarise, at higher temperatures, 
# the outputs from the model are kind of more random. 
# You can almost think of it as that at higher temperatures, 
# the assistant is more distractible, but maybe more creative.
