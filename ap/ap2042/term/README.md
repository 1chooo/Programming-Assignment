# Mid Term

## What I did?

- First download the from the NOAA
- Preview the data
- Analysis and plot the data with weekly mean, monthly mean, annual mean, and annual mean growth rates.
- Observing and record what I found.

## The record of Analysis part.

## My Thoughts

- Doing this project make me more closely to our earth, the activities of human have damaged our earth severely, almost every rates are increasingly, we must think twice to our mother land, or we will not have that comfortable life in the future.
-  This project improve my plotting skills with Python, and I also learn the new tech to add watermark on the figure I plotted, thatâ€™s so cool and this tech can promise that all figure belong to me.
